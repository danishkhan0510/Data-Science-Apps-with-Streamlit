# Data-Science-Apps-with-Streamlit
Web App creation for your Data Science projects have been made easy with Streamlit. Here are some projects to help you familiarize with Streamlit and Python.


## Project 1
### Simple Bioinformatics DNA Count
Packages used - Pandas, StreamLit, altair(for visualization), PIL(To import jpeg files)
We have the imported logo displayed at the top. Then we have a text area where we put the entire DNA sequence. A sequence has been implicitly provided. You can type your own sequence and hit Ctrl+Enter.
A dictionary gives you the count of Adenine(A), Thymine(T), Guanine(G), Cytosine(C). This is in the raw dictionary format which may not be readable by the user, so we display the entire strings in the next part. Then we create a data frame with the name and count of each entity which is printed subsequently. In the end we display a count chart for each entity.

## Project 2
### EDA Basketball
